Athena is a device-integrated AI assistant that automates cross-application workflows using real-time screen vision, LLM-based intent parsing, voice recognition, and native UI extraction across platforms. ATHENA “sees” your screen, “hears” commands, and interacts with applications via UI tree queries when possible.
